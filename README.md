# TAQA Admin Frontend

TAQA Admin is a React + TypeScript admin dashboard used to manage organizations, branches, users, registrations, onboarding, branch requests, work orders, and related authority/provider workflows.

## Tech Stack

- React 19
- TypeScript
- Vite (rolldown-vite)
- React Router
- TanStack Query
- Axios
- Tailwind CSS + Radix UI primitives
- React Hook Form + Zod
- Sonner (toasts)

## Project Architecture

The app is organized around pages, feature hooks, and shared infrastructure:

- `src/pages/` contains route-level screens and feature UI.
- `src/hooks/` contains data-fetching and mutation hooks per domain.
- `src/api/services/` contains API service methods grouped by module.
- `src/components/` contains app shell and reusable UI building blocks.
- `src/context/` contains global state providers (`AuthContext`).
- `src/lib/` contains shared utilities (permissions, access rules, helpers).
- `src/types/` contains domain and API typing contracts.

## Runtime Flow

### App Bootstrap

The app starts in `src/main.tsx`:

1. Creates a `QueryClient`.
2. Wraps app with `QueryClientProvider`.
3. Wraps app with `AuthProvider`.
4. Mounts `RouterProvider` with the hash router.

### Routing & Layout

- Router definition lives in `src/router.tsx` (`createHashRouter`).
- `/login` and `/register` are public.
- All authenticated app routes are nested under `/` and rendered inside `Layout`.
- `Layout` renders:
  - Sidebar (`AppSidebar`)
  - Top header
  - Page outlet (`<Outlet />`)

### Authentication

Authentication state is managed in `src/context/AuthContext.tsx`:

- Stores `user`, `organization`, `roles`, `permissions`, tokens, and loading state.
- On app load:
  - Reads `access_token` from local storage.
  - Calls `authService.me()` to hydrate identity and permissions.
- Exposes helpers:
  - `isAuthenticated`
  - `hasPermission`, `hasAnyPermission`, `hasAllPermissions`
  - `login` / `logout`

`ProtectedRoute` (`src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`) enforces login:

- Shows spinner while auth loads.
- Redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`.

### Authorization (Route-Level Access Control)

Route-level authorization is handled by:

- `src/lib/accessControl.ts`:
  - `ROUTE_ACCESS_RULES`
  - `canAccessByRule(...)`
  - `normalizePathKey(...)`
- `src/components/RouteAccessGuard.tsx`:
  - Evaluates route access using org type + permissions.
  - Renders page content when allowed.
  - Renders Access Denied UI when denied.

- `docs/route-access-guard-cycle.md`

### Sidebar Visibility

`src/components/AppSidebar.tsx` uses the same access-rule map (`ROUTE_ACCESS_RULES`) via `canAccessByRule(...)` to hide inaccessible menu items, keeping sidebar visibility aligned with page access guards.

## API Layer

The Axios client is configured in `src/api/config.ts`:

- Sets base URL to:
  - `https://enrgy-be-development.up.railway.app/api/`
- Adds `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on requests when token exists.
- Handles `401` with refresh-token flow:
  - Calls `auth/refresh`
  - Retries failed requests after refresh
  - Redirects to `#/login` if refresh fails

## Key Feature Areas

Major route domains in `src/router.tsx`:

- Auth: `login`, `register`
- Profile
- Organizations (authority)
- Branches & locations
- Users & roles
- Registrations & onboarding
- Service offerings/categories
- Fuel retail
- Branch requests
- Quotations
- Job orders
- Work orders + review queue
- Inspections & audit logs

## What's Implemented (Summary)

### What Currently Works in the App

- **Auth:** Login, register, route protection, token refresh on 401.
- **Profile:** View and edit user and organization data.
- **Authorization:** Route-level access via `RouteAccessGuard` and `accessControl.ts`; sidebar items are hidden by organization type and permissions.
- **Authority:**
  - **Organizations:** List, rejected list, organization details, create/register organization.
  - **Fuel Stations:** Approved, pending, rejected lists; details re-use the same organization page.
  - **Registrations:** List page shows “approved service provider organizations” via organizations API + `TableOrganization`; detail page `/registrations/:id` shows “registration request” from registrations API (`RegistrationDetails`).
  - **Onboarding:** List and detail pages.
  - **Job Orders:** List and detail pages.
  - **Inspections, Audit Log:** Routes are defined and working.
- **Service Provider / Fuel Station:**
  - **Users, Roles:** List, details, create, edit.
  - **Service Categories:** Service categories management.
  - **Provider RFQs, Provider Job Orders:** RFQ and job order list/detail.
  - **Locations:** Countries, governorates, cities, areas.
  - **Linked Providers:** Linked providers list.
  - **Quotations:** Financial offers (shared).
- **Infrastructure:** Axios + React Query, registration form with Zod, Radix + Tailwind UI, hash router.

## Unused or Not Wired

### 1. Components and Pages Written but Not Used

| Item | File | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **RegistrationsTable** | `src/pages/Registrations/component/RegistrationsTable.tsx` | Table that shows registrations from API `/registrations` with pagination, Approve/Reject actions, and links to `/registrations/:id`. **Not imported anywhere**; the list page `RegistrationsPage` uses `TableOrganization` + organizations API instead. |
| **fetchRegistrations** (list only) | `src/api/api.ts` | Fetches the registrations list from `/registrations`. Only used inside the unused `RegistrationsTable`. `fetchRegistrationById`, `approveRegistration`, and `rejectRegistration` are used in `RegistrationDetails`. |

### 2. Sidebar Links and Routes

The sidebar in `AppSidebar.tsx` points to these paths. They are **now defined** in `src/router.tsx`:

| Sidebar label | Path | Status |
|---------------|------|--------|
| Branches | `/branches` | Route added |
| Branch Requests | `/branch-requests` | Route added |
| Internal Work Orders | `/internal-work-orders` | Route added |
| External Requests | `/station-requests` | Route added |
| Station Job Orders | `/station-job-orders` | Route added |

Access rules for these paths exist in `src/lib/accessControl.ts`; the router now includes the corresponding routes.

### 3. Pages That Had No Route (Now Wired)

These pages/components were built but previously had no route; they are **now connected** in the router:

- **Branches:** `Branches.tsx`, `BranchDetails.tsx`, `CreateBranch.tsx`, `EditBranch.tsx` — routes: `/branches`, `/branches/create`, `/branches/:id`, `/branches/:id/edit`.
- **Branch Requests:** `BranchRequests.tsx`, `BranchRequestDetails.tsx`, `CreateBranchRequest.tsx` — routes: `/branch-requests`, `/branch-requests/create`, `/branch-requests/:id`.
- **Work Orders:** `WorkOrdersReviewQueue.tsx`, `WorkOrderDetails.tsx`, and components under `WorkOrders/` — routes: `/work-orders/review-queue`, `/work-orders/:id`.
- **Station:** `InternalWorkOrders.tsx`, `InternalWorkOrderDetail.tsx`, `InternalWorkOrdersReviewQueue.tsx`, `StationRequests.tsx`, `StationRequestDetail.tsx`, `StationJobOrders.tsx`, `StationJobOrderDetail.tsx`, `CreateMaintenanceRequest.tsx` — routes: `/internal-work-orders`, `/internal-work-orders/review-queue`, `/internal-work-orders/:id`, `/station-requests`, `/station-requests/create`, `/station-requests/:id`, `/station-job-orders`, `/station-job-orders/:id`.

## Route Audit (Legacy Reference)

The previous README included a route audit split by backend integration level. If needed, you can regenerate and maintain that list from `src/router.tsx`, but this README now focuses on overall project architecture and development flow.
